# Collections practice

## Task Ovierview

Welcome to the Collections Practice! In this project, you will work with basic collection operations such as filtering, grouping, and sorting.

Your task is similar to the TDD (Test-Driven Development) process: you are given failing tests, and your goal is to make all of them pass.

### Project Structure

This project contains two files:
- `src/main/kotlin/Main.kt` This is the main file of your project. It contains data classes and the `Library` class, which you need to complete by implementing all its methods.
- `src/test/kotlin/LibraryTest.kt` This is the test file. You can verify your implementation by running the tests in this file. To do so, click `Run Tests` next to the `LibraryTest` class or press `Ctrl+Shift+F10`.

You are free to add your own helper methods if it makes the implementation more convenient.
